        <h1>Hobbies & Interests</h1>
        <p id="subtitle">Having a good work/life balance is something everyone should strive for. I oftentimes can get overwhelmed with the work I have in front of me, but I'm realizing more and more how important it is to take care of yourself by doing the things you love! Here are a few things I love to do when I get the chance:</p>

                    <h3>Hiking</h3>
                    <p>One of my favourite ways to stay active is going on a good hike! I love taking in the nature around me, and feeling a sense of accomplishment when I get to the breathtaking views. My favourite hikes have been in Utah and Arizona, and I definitely hope for many more in my future. Hiking is also when my film camera gets the most use!</p>

                    <h3>Travel</h3>
                    <p>Travelling is an opportunity to learn more about the world around us, and appreciate the many cultures they entail. I've been very fortunate to be able to travel with loved ones throughout the years, and gain unforgettable experiences and memories. I find it amazing to be able to witness architecture, pieces of history, nature, and sceneries of different places.</p>

                    <h3>Puzzles</h3>
                    <p>I picked up this activity during the pandemic, and it instantly became one of my favourite hobbies. I find it relaxing to clear my mind and just focus on the pieces in front of me, and eventually after hours of hard work, create a beautiful picture. The puzzle above is the second 3000 piece puzzle I've done (took a lot of patience!) and one of my favourites.</p>

                    <h3>Arts & Crafts</h3>
                    <p>I've always loved being creative and "diy-ing" anything and everything. My many creations clutter my room, and oftentimes are derived from seemingly useless materials. I find it fun to reimagine these materials, for example, the denim tote bag above was created from scraps of my brother's old jeans. I enjoy drawing, sewing, and am starting to get into crocheting as well!</p>

                    <h3>Swimming</h3>
                    <p>Swimming has been a big part of my life from elementary school, all the way to highschool. I swam competitively with Mississauga's swim club for 7 years, and transitioned into coaching at the same club for 2 additional years. I also represented my highschool's team at OFSAA (provincials). Now, it's a fun way for me to stay active year-round. (Note the special feature from my dog Bruno)</p>
